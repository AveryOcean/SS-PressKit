# Compensation Social Music
These are the music files used in CompensationVR

## Why are some songs from the OST missing?
This Press Kit only includes songs that are / were used in builds of Compensation Social.
Songs like "Dorm Closet Theme" and "Sunshine" made it into a build, which is why they're missing.

## I want to use the missing music though!
Currently the songs that are missing were either made as a joke or were never used in Compensation Social.
Examples of these would be:
- Never Gonna CVR you up (Joke)
- Sunshine (Unused)
- Dorm Closet Theme (Unused)

If we do decide to add the unused songs they will be added in following path: ``Music/Compensation Social/Unused`` (Joke Songs not included)

## Where are the looped versions?
The looped versions of the OST are missing, because they're only used in-game.
If the majority of people, who use this kit, request the looped music we'll add it.
The music will then be found under ``Music/Compensation Social/Loops``

## What is Intermission?
Intermission is a track used in ``Raven/Amphitheatre`` as a track to be played whenever something is being set up on the stage or something goes wrong.
Intermission can be heard in the [Creation Tools Demo Livestream](https://youtu.be/1ybrixAR3-0?t=2433)
