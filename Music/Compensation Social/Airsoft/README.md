# Airsoft Music
This is the music used in the Airsoft Gamemode in Compensation Social.

## Isn't Lobby unused?
If you've played Airsoft in Compensation Social you'll know that the lobby theme is never heard anywhere in the game.
The reason that we decided to include it here is because it's in the game files.
However, you don't hear it in Compensation Social, because we thought that it would annoy players.
